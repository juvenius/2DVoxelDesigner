User Guide
======

When you first open the app by default the settings are set to a 30x30 grid with a 32-increment spacing:

If you want to change that just hit the **NEW** button and select the options you want:

If you want to trace an image, you can hit the **IMPORT IMAGE** button, select the image you want and Open:

(**Note**: If you are making an image to trace consider making it darker, that way it will be easier to see what you are tracing)

You can move it, scale it, and rotate it. Just remember to **LOCK IMAGE** once you have placed it the way you want it:

To rotate the image click/hold the red point in the middle of the image and drag it to where you want it:

Now just click and drag the points to where you want them (All the points are programed with voxel limitations in mind):

If it becomes difficult to see the grid because of similar colors in the image, you can click on the box next to the **LINE COLOR** and change the grid to a more visible color.
